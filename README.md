## RMTP
RTMP stands for Real-Time Messaging Protocol. It's a protocol developed by Adobe Systems for streaming audio, video, and data over the internet, between a Flash player and a server. RTMP is commonly used for live streaming and video-on-demand (VOD) services. It enables low-latency communication and supports adaptive bitrate streaming, making it suitable for various types of streaming applications. However, it's worth noting that RTMP has been gradually phased out in favor of newer protocols such as HLS (HTTP Live Streaming) and MPEG-DASH (Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP) due to broader compatibility and better support for modern devices and browsers.
